     * Thus in the music of the flute and of the lyre,
     * 'harmony' and rhythm alone are employed; also in other arts, such as that of the shepherd's pipe,
     * which are essentially similar to these. In dancing, rhythm alone is used without 'harmony'; for even dancing imitates character,
     * emotion, and action, by rhythmical movement.
