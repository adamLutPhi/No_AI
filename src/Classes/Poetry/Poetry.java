 * There are, again, some arts which employ all the means above-mentioned,
 * namely, rhythm, tune, and metre. Such are Dithyrambic and Nomic poetry, and also Tragedy and Comedy; but between them the difference is, that in the first two cases these means are all employed in combination,
 * in the latter, now one means is employed, now another.
